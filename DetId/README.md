## Deterministic ID

# Tool for testing.

During testing it is sometimes useful for the IDs generated by Gramps for handles and other purposes to be made consistant with the ones generated during test execution.

This is a small add-on which changes and resets the ID generation algorithm from a combination of date/random to a simple counter, starting at zero.  This makes handles easier to read, and you can infer the order of handle creation from the handle number during debugging.
